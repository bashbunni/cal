# Welcome to the bunni community calendar

This is where you can find my stream schedule and upcoming community events.

## Streams

### Co-working

I want to stream more often, which generally means I'll be doing co-working
streams. I'm also hoping to use some of these streams to crank out YouTube
videos.

### Go, duh

I'll continue to work on cool terminal tools on stream. All in Go btw. If you
have requests for projects you would like me to build, submit them in the
[discord](https://discord.gg/pMerKH2Y).

### Haskell: [Learn Haskell By Building a Blog Generator][haskell]

I really want to build a static site generator, so I can add a blog to my
website... But I have no idea if I'll figure out how to do it in Haskell...
We're going to try anyway, and you can watch me stare into the void of despair
along the way. :)

### [Ocaml??][ocaml]

I heard it's cool? I want to learn more functional programming and Haskell is
hard. Ocaml sounds interesting. Also, they have a cool camel Christmas sweater
that I want.

### Make my website not scuffed with Elm

Not sure yet if I'm going to start this before 2024, but this is officially on
the list.

## Community

I need to add more events for *my* community, but as of this moment, Prime is
more organized than I am, so I've listed some of his events down below.

### November

#### Helping Children's Hospitals [3]

My good friend [@theprimeagen][prime] is doing his annual fundraiser with extra
life on **November 3rd** to fundraise for a children's hospital. I would join
him in his 24-hour stream again, but alas I won't be at my setup.

### December

#### Advent of code!! [1-25]

 Great opportunity to practice your problem-solving abilities and potentially
 learn a new language??

#### NeovimConf [9-10??]

I have no idea what the date is, probably some time around the 9th or 10th of
December... I might do a talk, we'll see. Either way, will be a fun event!
