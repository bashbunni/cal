# THE HASKELL CHAPTER

We're going to learn some functional programming. I've chosen Haskell because
it is a pure functional language. Whether it's something I actually end up
using in projects going forward is to be decided, but I think learning an
opinionated language will open my eyes to new ways of problem-solving. 

That's the goal for this exercise.

## RESOURCES

Let's use [Building a Blog Generator in Haskell][blog] as a tutorial to start
building something right off the bat. I'll keep track of the questions that
come up along the way and supplement my learning to make sure I'm understanding
the concepts well enough to explain it to others.

We can all be rubber duckies while learning this new skill.
